		<h2>About Me</h2>

		<p>I was born in the Silicon Valley in the late 80s, and have lived all over the bay area.  I was a nerdy kid in high school who built PCs for fun, and that led me to an interest in computer engineering.  I went to study the subject at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and found a love of surfing, rock climbing, and triathlon training while there.</p>

		<p>Hardware is my background by career, but a desire to learn more software is what led me to get involved with the UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp.  That led to creation of this portfolio page (which I've always wanted to have one!) and now I can track some of my personal projects.</p>

		<p>I need a third paragraph to tie it all together</p>
